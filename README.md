A small project that aims to use logistic regression to classify input images into two classes (American vs European Streets). 
This project may be expanded in the future to improve model performance. Currently, it demonstrates feature encoding, logistic regression with gradient descent, and analysis of model vs human decisions.
The PowerPoint presentation from the Human and Machine Learning class, which explains the project in more detail, is linked at the bottom of the README.
